# not edit the version of this script found in other directories. When

# it must then be be copied into other directories. This is necessary as
# Docker when building an image cannot copy in a file from outside of
# the directory where the Dockerfile resides.

# This script will run 'mod_wsgi-express start-server', adding in some
# additional initial arguments to send logging to the terminal and to
# force the use of port 80. If necessary the port to use can be overridden
# using the PORT environment variable.

# Run any user supplied script to be run prior to starting the
# application in the actual container. The script must be executable in
# order to be run. It is not possible for this script to change the
# permissions so it is executable and then run it, due to some docker
# bug which results in the text file being busy. For more details see:
