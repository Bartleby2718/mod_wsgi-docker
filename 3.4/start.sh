# The master for this script exists in the Python '2.7' directory. Do
# not edit the version of this script found in other directories. When

# it must then be be copied into other directories. This is necessary as
# Docker when building an image cannot copy in a file from outside of
# the directory where the Dockerfile resides.

# This script will run 'mod_wsgi-express start-server', adding in some
# additional initial arguments to send logging to the terminal and to
# force the use of port 80. If necessary the port to use can be overridden
# using the PORT environment variable.

# Docker will have set any environment variables defined in the image or
# on the command line when the container has been run. Here we are going
# to look for any statically defined environment variables provided by
# the user as part of the actual application. These will have been
# placed in the '.docker/user_vars' directory. The name of the file
# corresponds to the name of the environment variable and the contents
# of the file the value to set the environment variable to. Each of the
# environment variables is set and exported.
