# The master for this script exists in the Python '2.7' directory. Do
# not edit the version of this script found in other directories. When
# the version of the script in the Python '2.7' directory is modified,
# it must then be be copied into other directories. This is necessary as
# Docker when building an image cannot copy in a file from outside of
# the directory where the Dockerfile resides.

# This script will run 'mod_wsgi-express start-server', adding in some
# additional initial arguments to send logging to the terminal and to
# force the use of port 80. If necessary the port to use can be overridden
# using the PORT environment variable.
